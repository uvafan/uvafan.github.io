  <h3> Effective Altruism </h3>

  I'm part of the <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.com">effective altruism</a> movement, which aims to use reason
  and evidence to improve the world as much as possible. I've taken the <a
    href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">Giving What We Can Pledge</a> to donate at least 10% of my lifetime
  income to charities I think are the most effective. I write more about effective altruism <a
    href="https://foxy-scout.com/why-effective-altruism/">here</a>.

  <h3> Career </h3>

  I'm working on various projects related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment">AI alignment</a>.
  I advise and sometimes do part-time work for <a href="https://sage-future.org/">Sage</a>, an forecasting organization I cofounded.
  I previously worked at <a href="https://ought.org/">Ought</a> on the AI research assistant <a href="https://elicit.org/">Elicit</a>.

<h3> Writing</h3>

My blog is at <a href="https://www.foxy-scout.com/">foxy-scout.com</a>. I often crosspost to the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/elifland">Effective Altruism Forum</a> or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/elifland">LessWrong</a>.

  <h3> Forecasting </h3>

  I'm interested in judgmental forecasting as a route to improved decision making. I recommend <a
    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting">Superforecasting</a> for an introduction, but I think it overclaims in some ways (e.g. regarding <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qZqvBLvR5hX9sEkjR/comparing-top-forecasters-and-domain-experts">generalists vs. expertise</a>). 
    I co-lead the <a href="https://samotsvety.org/">Samotsvety Forecasting</a> team. My forecasting track record 
    is described <a href="https://www.foxy-scout.com/retro/">here</a>.

  <h3> AI Research </h3>

  During my last year of college, I co-created <a href="https://github.com/QData/TextAttack">TextAttack</a>, a Python
  framework for adversarial attacks in NLP. See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05909">paper</a> or <a
    href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-adversarial-examples-in-nlp-f928c574478e">blog post</a>. We also
  published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14174">paper</a> arguing for stricter evaluation of adversarial
  examples in NLP. While at Ought, I co-created the <a href="https://raft.elicit.org/">RAFT Benchmark</a>

  <h3> Board games. </h3>

  I like playing strategy games. The latest one I'm into is <a
    href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars">Terraforming Mars</a>. It's a board game with
  some online adaptations. I also sometimes play chess.

  <h3> Education </h3>

  I have degrees in computer science and economics from the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">University of
    Virginia</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxA3Xd4DXCY">2019 NCAA basketball national champions</a>!

  <h3> Previous dimensions </h3>

  <h4> Battlecode </h4>

  I competed in <a href="https://battlecode.org/">Battlecode</a> for several years, a competition for high-school and
  college students to program the best bot to win a strategy game. My team advanced to the top 4 3 out of 6 years. See
  <a href="https://github.com/uvafan/bc20">the README here</a> for more.

  <h4> Clash Royale </h4>

  During the end of high school and beginning of college, I was addicted to the mobile game, Clash Royale, did well in a
  few competitions and built up a bit of a following before quitting. My YouTube channel was <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx6U0bPb5XpShjnAmI_LXHw">here</a>.

  <h4> Speedcubing </h4>

  During middle school and early in high school, I spent a lot of time solving Rubik's cubes as fast as I could (and
  doing them one-handed and blindfolded). My WCA profile is <a
    href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012LIFL01">here</a>; I was decent but not world class.
